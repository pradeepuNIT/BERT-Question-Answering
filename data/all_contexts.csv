Article num,Context
Article 1,"Application of UCP: The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, 2007 Revision, ICC Publication no. 600 ('UCP') are rules that apply to any documentary credit ('credit') (including, to the extent to which they may be applicable, any standby letter of credit) when the text of the credit expressly indicates that it is subject to these rules. They are binding on all parties thereto unless expressly modified or excluded by the credit."
Article 10,"Amendments: Except as otherwise provided by article 38, a credit can neither be amended nor cancelled without the agreement of the issuing bank, the confirming bank, if any, and the beneficiary; An issuing bank is irrevocably bound by an amendment as of the time it issues the amendment. A confirming bank may extend its confirmation to an amendment and will be irrevocably bound as of the time it advises the amendment. A confirming bank may, however, choose to advise an amendment without extending its confirmation and, if so, it must inform the issuing bank without delay and inform the beneficiary in its advice; The terms and conditions of the original credit (or a credit incorporating previously accepted amendments) will remain in force for the beneficiary until the beneficiary communicates its acceptance of the amendment to the bank that advised such amendment. The beneficiary should give notification of acceptance or rejection of an amendment. If the beneficiary fails to give such notification, a presentation that complies with the credit and to any not yet accepted amendment will be deemed to be notification of acceptance by the beneficiary of such amendment. As of that moment the credit will be amended; A bank that advises an amendment should inform the bank from which it received the amendment of any notification of acceptance or rejection; Partial acceptance of an amendment is not allowed and will be deemed to be notification of rejection of the amendment; A provision in an amendment to the effect that the amendment shall enter into force unless rejected by the beneficiary within a certain time shall be disregarded."
Article 11,"Teletransmitted and Pre-Advised Credits and Amendments: An authenticated tele-transmission of a credit or amendment will be deemed to be the operative credit or amendment, and any subsequent mail confirmation shall be disregarded. If a tele-transmission states 'full details to follow' (or words of similar effect), or states that the mail confirmation is to be the operative credit or amendment, then the tele-transmission will not be deemed to be the operative credit or amendment. The issuing bank must then issue the operative credit or amendment without delay in terms not inconsistent with the tele-transmission; A preliminary advice of the issuance of a credit or amendment ('pre-advice') shall only be sent if the issuing bank is prepared to issue the operative credit or amendment. An issuing bank that sends a pre- advice is irrevocably committed to issue the operative credit or amendment, without delay, in terms not inconsistent with the pre-advice."
Article 12,"Nomination: Unless a nominated bank is the confirming bank, an authorization to honour or negotiate does not impose any obligation on that nominated bank to honour or negotiate, except when expressly agreed to by that nominated bank and so communicated to the beneficiary; By nominating a bank to accept a draft or incur a deferred payment undertaking, an issuing bank authorizes that nominated bank to prepay or purchase a draft accepted or a deferred payment undertaking incurred by that nominated bank; Receipt or examination and forwarding of documents by a nominated bank that is not a confirming bank does not make that nominated bank liable to honour or negotiate, nor does it constitute honour or negotiation."
Article 13,"Bank-to-Bank Reimbursement Arrangements: If a credit states that reimbursement is to be obtained by a nominated bank ('claiming bank') claiming on another party ('reimbursing bank'), the credit must state if the reimbursement is subject to the ICC rules for bank-to-bank reimbursements in effect on the date of issuance of the credit; If a credit does not state that reimbursement is subject to the ICC rules for bank-to-bank reimbursements, the following apply: i.An issuing bank must provide a reimbursing bank with a reimbursement authorization that conforms with the availability stated in the credit. The reimbursement authorization should not be subject to an expiry date; A claiming bank shall not be required to supply a reimbursing bank with a certificate of compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit; An issuing bank will be responsible for any loss of interest, together with any expenses incurred, if reimbursement is not provided on first demand by a reimbursing bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit; A reimbursing bank's charges are for the account of the issuing bank. However, if the charges are for the account of the beneficiary, it is the responsibility of an issuing bank to so indicate in the credit and in the reimbursement authorization. If a reimbursing bank's charges are for the account of the beneficiary, they shall be deducted from the amount due to a claiming bank when reimbursement is made. If no reimbursement is made, the reimbursing bank's charges remain the obligation of the issuing bank; An issuing bank is not relieved of any of its obligations to provide reimbursement if reimbursement is not made by a reimbursing bank on first demand."
Article 15,"Complying Presentation: When an issuing bank determines that a presentation is complying, it must honour; When a confirming bank determines that a presentation is complying, it must honour or negotiate and forward the documents to the issuing bank; When a nominated bank determines that a presentation is complying and honours or negotiates, it must forward the documents to the confirming bank or issuing bank."
Article 16,"Discrepant Documents, Waiver and Notice: When a nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, or the issuing bank determines that a presentation does not comply, it may refuse to honour or negotiate; When an issuing bank determines that a presentation does not comply, it may in its sole judgement approach the applicant for a waiver of the discrepancies. This does not, however, extend the period mentioned in sub-article 14 (b); When a nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, or the issuing bank decides to refuse to honour or negotiate, it must give a single notice to that effect to the presenter. The notice must state; that the bank is refusing to honour or negotiate; and each discrepancy in respect of which the bank refuses to honour or negotiate; and a) that the bank is holding the documents pending further instructions from the presenter; or b) that the issuing bank is holding the documents until it receives a waiver from the applicant and agrees to accept it, or receives further instructions from the presenter prior to agreeing to accept a waiver; or c) that the bank is returning the documents; or d) that the bank is acting in accordance with instructions previously received from the presenter; The notice required in sub-article 16 (c) must be given by telecommunication or, if that is not possible, by other expeditious means no later than the close of the fifth banking day following the day of presentation; A nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, or the issuing bank may, after providing notice required by sub-article 16 (c) (iii) (a) or (b), return the documents to the presenter at any time; If an issuing bank or a confirming bank fails to act in accordance with the provisions of this article, it shall be precluded from claiming that the documents do not constitute a complying presentation; When an issuing bank refuses to honour or a confirming bank refuses to honour or negotiate and has given notice to that effect in accordance with this article, it shall then be entitled to claim a refund, with interest, of any reimbursement made."
Article 17,"Original Documents and Copies: At least one original of each document stipulated in the credit must be presented; A bank shall treat as an original any document bearing an apparently original signature, mark, stamp, or label of the issuer of the document, unless the document itself indicates that it is not an original; Unless a document indicates otherwise, a bank will also accept a document as original if it; appears to be written, typed, perforated or stamped by the document issuer's hand; or appears to be on the document issuer's original stationery; or states that it is original, unless the statement appears not to apply to the document presented; If a credit requires presentation of copies of documents, presentation of either originals or copies is permitted; If a credit requires presentation of multiple documents by using terms such as 'in duplicate', 'in two fold' or 'in two copies', this will be satisfied by the presentation of at least one original and the remaining number in copies, except when the document itself indicates otherwise."

If a credit states that charges are for the account of the beneficiary and charges cannot be collected or deducted from proceeds, the issuing bank remains liable for payment of charges. A credit or amendment should not stipulate that the advising to a beneficiary is conditional upon the receipt by the advising bank or second advising bank of its charges; The applicant shall be bound by and liable to indemnify a bank against all obligations and responsibilities imposed by foreign laws and usages."
Article 39,"Assignment of Proceeds: The fact that a credit is not stated to be transferable shall not affect the right of the beneficiary to assign any proceeds to which it may be or may become entitled under the credit, in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. This article relates only to the assignment of proceeds and not to the assignment of the right to perform under the credit."
Article 4,"Credits v. Contracts: A credit by its nature is a separate transaction from the sale or other contract on which it may be based. Banks are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract, even if any reference whatsoever to it is included in the credit. Consequently, the undertaking of a bank to honour, to negotiate or to fulfil any other obligation under the credit is not subject to claims or defences by the applicant resulting from its relationships with the issuing bank or the beneficiary. A beneficiary can in no case avail itself of the contractual relationships existing between banks or between the applicant and the issuing bank; An issuing bank should discourage any attempt by the applicant to include, as an integral part of the credit, copies of the underlying contract, proforma invoice and the like."

A place for presentation other than that of the issuing bank is in addition to the place of the issuing bank; Except as provided in sub-article 29 (a), a presentation by or on behalf of the beneficiary must be made on or before the expiry date."

A confirming bank's undertaking to reimburse another nominated bank is independent of the confirming bank's undertaking to the beneficiary; If a bank is authorized or requested by the issuing bank to confirm a credit but is not prepared to do so, it must inform the issuing bank without delay and may advise the credit without confirmation."
Article 9,"Advising of Credits and Amendments: A credit and any amendment may be advised to a beneficiary through an advising bank. An advising bank that is not a confirming bank advises the credit and any amendment without any undertaking to honour or negotiate; By advising the credit or amendment, the advising bank signifies that it has satisfied itself as to the apparent authenticity of the credit or amendment and that the advice accurately reflects the terms and conditions of the credit or amendment received; An advising bank may utilize the services of another bank ('second advising bank') to advise the credit and any amendment to the beneficiary.
